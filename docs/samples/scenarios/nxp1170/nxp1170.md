# Scenario: Updating a MIMXRT1170-EVK Board

```bash
python3 -mpip install -U pyocd
```

## Connect to board
1. Plug in board
2. Download and install Putty
3. Connect to serial port (like COM3) with speed 115200.
If you have the default out-of-box demo, you'll see a stream of
x=<value>, y=<value> messages coming in.
Rotate the board and observe the value changes.
