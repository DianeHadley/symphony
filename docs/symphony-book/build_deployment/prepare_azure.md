# Prepare Azure Resources

Symphony doesn't have depedencies on Azure resources. However, to run through sample scenarios and demos, you need to create a few Azure resources to support Azure IoT Hub scenarios.

> **NOTE:** All instructions below are provided as Azure CLI commands. Use Azure Cloud Shell if you don't have the CLI installed locally. We assume you've already logged in (az login).

## 1. Create a resource group
We require some standard tier and premium tier offers, so the testing wonâ€™t be free. We recommend keeping all you demo resources under the same resource group so that you can easily clean up your environment once you are done.

```bash
az group create -l <location> -n <resource group name>
NOTE: Choose a location where all services are available, such as westus2.
```
## 2. Create an IoT Hub
```bash
az iot hub create --resource-group <resource group name> --name <IoT Hub name> --sku S1 --partition-count 2
```
> **NOTE:** We need standard tiers (S1, S2 or S3). You can choose a different --partition-count as desired (default is 4). For lite tests a single parition may be sufficient.
## 3. Create an IoT Edge device
Symphony can acts both as a control plane and a deployment target (we call target). When it's used as a target, it corresponds to an IoT Edge device, when IoT Edge modules are used.
```bash
az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name <Iot Hub name> --device-id <device id> --edge-enabled
```
> **NOTE:** In most sample scenairos, we'll use Symphony as both the control plane and the target.
