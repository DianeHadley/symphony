# Deploy Symphony Behind API Management Service
It may be preferrable to deploy Symphony API behind an [API Management Serivce](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management) for static IP and domain names, automatic certificate binding, and monitoring.

You can use the OpenAPI V3 Yaml [here](../api/Symphony.openapi.yaml) to help you to create APIM configuration.
